   Indicators: "cancel", "cancel my", "cancel service", "cancel order", "stop service", "remove order", "cancel booking", "want to cancel", "need to cancel", "i want to cancel"
   Also check for: User ID patterns (8-character alphanumeric) + "cancel"

2. SERVICE_BOOKING (Confidence: 0.95):
   Indicators: "book", "order", "purchase", "buy", "get service", "need service", "want service", "hire", "request service"
   EXCLUDE if cancellation detected first
   Action: Initiate booking process

3. SERVICE_INQUIRY (Confidence: 0.85):
   Indicators: "what services", "what do you offer", "list of services", "available services", "what can you do", "services do you provide"
   Action: Use comprehensive service search with all 21 services

4. SOCIAL_MEDIA_REQUEST (Confidence: 0.90):
   Indicators: "facebook", "linkedin", "twitter", "social media", "social profiles"
   Action: Provide social media links

5. CONTACT_REQUEST (Confidence: 0.85):

- Look for User ID patterns: [A-Z0-9]{8}
- Consider context: "cancel my service", "want to cancel", etc.
- Immediately route to cancellation handler

DECISION LOGIC:
- Prioritize CANCELLATION above all other intents
- Then prioritize high-confidence intents (SERVICE_BOOKING, SOCIAL_MEDIA)
- Default to COMPANY_INFO for complex or unclear queries
- Use SERVICE_INQUIRY for any service-related questions
- Only classify as GREETING for very simple greetings
